# The cgroups pids controller can limit the number of tasks started by
# the daemon, which can limit the number of domains for some hypervisors.
# A conservative default of 8 tasks per guest results in a TasksMax of
# 32k to support 4096 guests.

# With cgroups v2 there is no devices controller anymore, we have to use
# eBPF to control access to devices. In order to do that we create a eBPF
# hash MAP which locks memory. The default map size for 64 devices together
# with program takes 12k per guest. After rounding up we will get 64M to
# support 4096 guests.
