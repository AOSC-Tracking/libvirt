# With cgroups v2 there is no devices controller anymore, we have to use
# eBPF to control access to devices. In order to do that we create a eBPF
# hash MAP which locks memory. The default map size for 64 devices together
# with program takes 12k per guest. After rounding up we will get 64M to
# support 4096 guests.
